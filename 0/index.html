	<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
    <p>
		For this assignment we created an Amazon Web Services account, and set up a server instance to be used for the duration of this class.
		After we launched the server instance we ran several commands to set up programs such as mySQL and PHP. 
		We also configured our individual development environments to be able to connect via SSH and FTP to our AWS instance
		Finally we created a sample webpage to demonstrate the success of our setup.

The basic premise of The Web is Dead relies on a distinction between the Web and the Internet. 
The Web, as Chris Anderson seems to define it, is the series of interconnected, physical webpages 
that one would find using a web browser, whereas the Internet is just a medium through which we 
send and receive data. He argues that though usage of the Internet is very high, through social 
media apps, online gaming, and music streaming, our use of the Web, literally using an Internet 
browser on a computer, is on decline. Immediately after reading the  article, I reflected on my 
own usage. Indeed, when I was first introduced to the Internet, I used websites like Wikipedia, 
for quick reference on some random subject, Yahoo, for email, and dictionary.com, to look up words 
I did not know. A decade later, I definitely use the Internet as Chris Anderson describes it - to 
get information. Everyday on my phone, I check Facebook, email, Twitter, eBay, woot.com, and YouTube. 
There's definitely a difference in what I access through the Internet and how I access, and by Chris 
Anderson's definitions, I am the epitome of the dying web.
